        <h2 class="subheading">In a nutshell...</h2>
        <p class="about-text">I am a 26 year old Team Lead at MSCI, where I play the role of manager, coach and talent developer to a team of 8 financial data analysts. Together, we help investors get greater transparency into the financial markets and their own portfolios, powering better investment decisions for the entire world.</p>
        <p class="about-text">On a regular day at work, I help my team meet project deadlines, improve data quality, resolve client queries through Dynamics 365, and help them be the very best they can be, coaching them through difficult stretches and helping them leverage opportunities for growth.</p>
        <p class="about-text">I approach everything with a lean mindset, with Web3 leading the way and cultivating a positive culture being at the center of everything.</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">...but wait there's more</h2>
        <p class="about-text">Unlike your typical finance hero, I have a little bit more of a creative side which I discovered during my career in finance.</p>
        <p class="about-text">Over the years my interest in tech and Web3 was piqued. I now enjoy spending hours creating websites like this one, and experimenting with different styles too. When I'm not having fun creating classes and flexing displays, I may also spend hours editing in Lightroom after a photoshoot.</p>
        <p class="about-text">While I have my roots embedded in corporate finance, my trajectory has shifted towards the tech industry.</p>
